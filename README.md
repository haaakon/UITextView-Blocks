UITextView-Blocks
==================

Adds blocks to all UITextView delegate methods with a category, no subclassing. Also allows the use of delegate methods if no block is set.

Installation
============
Simply use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):

`pod 'UITextView+Blocks'`

USAGE
=====

#### TextFieldShouldBeginEditing
```objective-c

#import <UITextView+Blocks.h>
UITextView *aTextField;
[aTextField setShouldBegindEditingBlock:^BOOL(UITextView *textField) {
        // do your stuff here
        return YES;
}];
    
```

#### textFieldDidBeginEditing

```objective-c
[aTextField setDidBeginEditingBlock:^(UITextView *textField) {
        // do your stuff here
}];
    
```

#### textFieldShouldEndEditing

```objective-c
[aTextField setShouldEndEditingBlock:^BOOL(UITextView *textField) {
        // do your stuff here
        return YES;
  }];
    
```

#### textFieldDidEndEditing

```objective-c
[aTextField setDidEndEditingBlock:^BOOL(UITextView *textField) {
        // do your stuff here
  }];
    
```

#### textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString:

```objective-c
[aTextField setShouldChangeCharactersInRangeBlock:^BOOL(UITextView *textField, NSRange range, NSString *replacementString) {
        // do your stuff here
        return YES;
}];
```
#### textFieldShouldClear

```objective-c
[aTextField setShouldClearBlock:^BOOL(UITextView *textField) {
        // do your stuff here
        return NO;
}];
```
#### textFieldShouldReturn
```objective-c
[aTextField setShouldReturnBlock:^BOOL(UITextView *textField) {
        // do your stuff here
        return NO;
}];
```    

Remember, you can also use ordinary delegate methods for all methods you don't define as blocks.

In this example, shouldBeginEditing is defined as a block, and didEndEditing is a delegate method

```objective-c

aTextField.delegate = self;

[aTextField setShouldBegindEditingBlock:^BOOL(UITextView *textField) {
        // do your stuff here
        return YES;
    }];

- (void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextView *)textField
{
    // do your stuff here
}
```
